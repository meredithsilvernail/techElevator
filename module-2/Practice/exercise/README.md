- SELECT, WHERE, and JOIN statements
- ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses
- INSERT and UPDATE statements
- DAO methods
- Creating domain objects from SQL data

## Instructions

1. Create database module-2-practice
2. In DbVisualizer create a Connection to the module-2-practice database 
3. In DbVisualizer create a Connection load and run the imports-tables.sql script (part1 folder)
4. Fill out the `solution.sql` file with the correct SQL statements to satisfy the requirements.
5. `part-2` Complete the `DAO` class and unit tests to check the correctness of the methods.
